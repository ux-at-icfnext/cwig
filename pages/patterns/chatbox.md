  On default, the chatbox will be in its closed state. OnClick/OnTap of the closed state chatbox, it will go to open state, showing a text input space for the user to type in their question. On big screens, the user will continue to see the website behind them, and have the option to minimize the chatbox. On smaller screens, the chatbox will take up the entire screen, with the option to minimize it.
