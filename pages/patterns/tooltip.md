  When to use the tooltip component
  - **Helpful, non-critical information.** Use tooltips to strengthen an existing message.
  - **Enhance confidence.** Use tooltips to increase certainty about an interaction.
  - **Brief descriptions.** Tooltips perform best with succinct helper text.
  - **Lack of space.** Tooltips are useful as a last resort for space-constrained UI. Explore other options for keeping content visible without a tooltip.
