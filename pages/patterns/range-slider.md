  **When to use the range slider component** 
  When the range is more important than precision. For instance, it could be more important for a target price selector to communicate where the target price falls within a certain range than the precise dollar amount selected.
  When a relative value is more important than an exact value. For instance, a volume slider is typically more focussed on the relative loudness of the output rather than the specific decibel level.
