## Language
Button text should be as short as possible and lead with action words that clearly explain what will happen when the button is selected. (For example, Download, Login, Submit)

## Accessibility
It is critical that buttons conform to Section 508 best practices so that they can be used successfully by everyone. 
So, contrast of the button and text colors should meet W3C guidelines and alt text is required for all button text, except for disabled buttons (as disabled elements do not need to be read). 
Note that these buttons, if used as designed, are 508 compliant.



## Analytics Tracking
In general, all buttons should have tracking. This allows analytics for user actions on the site. 
SAMHSA developers need to ensure that there is some identifying feature on the button such as a click ID or click class. 
Analytics events are set-up by the HHS analytics team once the web page is deployed.##

## Buttons with input boxes
Input box with single button The button is attached to the end of the input box in large spaces â€“ or stacked on smaller spaces.
- If there are multiple buttons, the input box does not have an attached button and the [button group](/button-group) is used to group the buttons.
