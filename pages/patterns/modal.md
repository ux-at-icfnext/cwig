specification: |
  ### Default & large modal
  - OnClick/OnTap modal opens over window. 
  - Modal should be no more than 95% of the screen width, making sure that the close button is in view
  - On smaller devices modal needs to scroll if it falls below the screen fold. ** NOTE ** This behavior does not come with the default USWDS! 
  - OnClick/OnTap of close button or outside of the modal window, modal closes.

  ### Modal with Forced Action
  - This modal functions in the same way as the default modal ** except ** modal only closes through button interactions, not from clicking on the screen.
