  When to use the tag component

  - **To draw attention to new, important content.** Tags can focus attention on important content on that might otherwise be missed.

  - **To filter results with one or more tags.**

  - **To indicate the number of new or unread items within a container.** For example, to indicate the number of unread emails within a personâ€™s inbox.

  When to consider something else

  - **Confusion with buttons.** Avoid tags if they might appear in the same area of the page as buttons.

  - **New or updated content.** To call attention to new or updated content, consider changing the background color of the object itself or experiment with changing the font weight.

  - **When users already expect content to be updated frequently.** For example, on a site dedicated to breaking news. In this case placing the new content at the top may be enough.
