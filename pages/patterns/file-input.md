specification: |
  The file input box can be set to allow the following inputs:
  <br /> - Single file upload
  <br /> - multiple file upload
  <br /> - Text or PDF only
  <br /> - Image only
  <br /><br />
  <br />See the variations below for examples of error and disabled states.
  <br /><br />
  <br /><br /><strong>Functionality</strong>
  <br />- OnClick/OnTap of input, system displays file upload. User is able to navigate their system to select a file. 
  <br />- OR on drag and drop, the user is able to drop their file onto the input.

  <br />- On choosing file, system then displays the chosen file amd holds it in memory. The option to "change the file" appears

  <br />- If the user selects "change the file", the system unloads the file from memory and opens the system to navigate to a new file.
  <br />- On submission of form, the system saves the file to the chosen location.
  <br /><br /> NOTE: you can use the design above to try out this fuctionality

  <br /><br /><strong>Error State</strong> is a user uploads a file that does not fit the established parameters... the system displays the error state and the form is not submitted.
