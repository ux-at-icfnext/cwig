specification: |
  The file input box can be set to allow the following inputs:
   - Single file upload
   - multiple file upload
   - Text or PDF only
   - Image only
  See the variations below for examples of error and disabled states.
  
  **Functionality**
  - OnClick/OnTap of input, system displays file upload. User is able to navigate their system to select a file. 
  - OR on drag and drop, the user is able to drop their file onto the input.
  - On choosing file, system then displays the chosen file amd holds it in memory. The option to "change the file" appears
  - If the user selects "change the file", the system unloads the file from memory and opens the system to navigate to a new file.
  - On submission of form, the system saves the file to the chosen location.
  NOTE: you can use the design above to try out this fuctionality

  **Error State** is a user uploads a file that does not fit the established parameters... the system displays the error state and the form is not submitted.
