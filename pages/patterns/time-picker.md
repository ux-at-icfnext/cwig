  When to use the time picker component
  
  **Scheduling.** Use the time picker to schedule a time from common, consistent increments, such as planning a meeting time in 30-minute blocks.

  When to consider something else

  **Exact time.** Plain text input is more appropriate for historical exact times, like time of birth.
