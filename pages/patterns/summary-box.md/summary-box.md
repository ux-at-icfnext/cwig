specification: 
When to use the summary box component
Summarize dense content. If your page contains a lot of information, use the summary box to call out 3-5 key details that readers shouldnâ€™t miss.
Highlight a short, actionable list. If the page content describes a few steps or a checklist of items to remember, collect them in a summary box. Use five bullet points or less.
