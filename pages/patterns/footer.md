description: |
  A footer houses links that are deemed as important to have global access. They are secondary to the types of links housed typically in the main menu, though there may be some duplication (for instance repetition of the top level menu links).

  Keep in mind that there are certain links that are required by the [21st Century IDEA](https://digital.gov/resources/required-web-content-and-links/?dg). These links are located in the [identifier](/indentifier) which sits right below the footer. Do not duplicate these links in the footer.
