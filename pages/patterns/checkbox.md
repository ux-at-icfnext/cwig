<br/><br/>
Checkboxes are an easily understandable way to indicate that users can select one or more answers to a question or items from a list. They’re always followed by a label or instructions that clearly indicate what checking the box represents."

specification: |
  Each checkbox has two different states: selected or unselected, which are similar to an on and off switch. If a checkbox label says “Yes, send me an email,” it’s clear what checking that box (or not checking it) will accomplish.
  <br/> <br/>
  Checkboxes also visibly show users what’s been selected and makes it easy for them to “uncheck” an option, which can be difficult with other selection methods on a form (such as radio buttons or dropdown boxes). It’s common to include “check all that apply” instructions with checkboxes to let users know it’s okay to select more than one option at a time.
