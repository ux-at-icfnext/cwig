  Child Welfare Information Gateway was developed to achieve the Children's Bureau's vision of a single informational resource for the field covering its entire topical scope. Information Gateway aligns our services and products to better reflect our values and be more responsive to the needs and priorities of Federal, State, and local child welfare agencies. For child welfare and many other related professionals, Information Gateway is the one stop for a full continuum of timely resources, including essential information on programs, research, laws and policies, training approaches, and statistics.
