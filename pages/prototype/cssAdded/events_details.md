about: >
  This workshop gives participants the opportunity to “test-drive” the five research-based Strengthening Families™ Protective Factors that are proven to keep children safe and families strong. Highly interactive, fun, and informative- the workshop begins with understanding the impact of adverse childhood experiences (ACES) and presents the protective factors as a concrete way to mitigate the long-term impact of trauma.
