intro: | 
    Family-centered practice is a way of working with families, both formally and informally, across service systems to enhance their capacity to care for and protect their children. It focuses on children's safety and needs within the context of their families and communities and builds on families' strengths to achieve optimal outcomes. Families are defined broadly to include birth, blended, kinship, and foster and adoptive families.
    
    This section addresses key elements of family-centered practice and provides overarching strategies for family-centered casework practice across child welfare service systems that focus on strengths, engage families and involve them in decision-making, advocate for improving families' conditions, and engage communities to support families. Strategies for creating a family-centered agency culture are also addressed.
