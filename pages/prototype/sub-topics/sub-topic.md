I help people find resources on a related topic. I can be found by browsing through the Topics page. If I'm important or timely, I may find myself called out on the home page. I could also be featured in secondary CTA's like _You May Also Like_ or _Related Topics_. I will also be available through global search where I can be find by keywords in my title on in my body content (this paragrapg you are reading now).

If needed to explain my purpose, I can go up to 500 words. But it is perfered that you keep me to 250, so that visitors can quickly get to the resources I house.
