## Feature Section

Uses [hero pattern]().
- Page Title | h1
- Page description | text | 250 character max (ask @christine if this is right)

## Body section
Uses [vertical tabs pattern](/vertical-tabs).

Vertical tabs share all main characteristics of the horizontal tab. Vertical tabs provide better scalability for a large amount of tabs (ten and more). Vertical tabs have a text label and a description. A description without text label is not possible.

Each tab:

- text label | 
- h2
- body text | p
- uses [accordion pattern](/accordion)

    An accordion is a list of headers that hide or reveal additional content when selected. They are helpful for keeping pages clean and easy to navigate.
